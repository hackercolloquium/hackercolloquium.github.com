I have been thinking about this sort of forum for a while now. I wanted to create a place where developers can hone their craft. Feel comfortable in an environment where they are not afraid to discuss ideas and feel as though they want to better themselves. As a kid I always loved watching movies about really smart people who created something wonderful or achieved something extraordinary. This always inspired me and I wanted to create an environment where I felt that way everyday. I feel that the software development field has lost it's way and has become stagnant (Javascript ecosphere excluded). If there was an environment where there is a group of people pushing the field forward, that's where I want to be.
